# NTD-Name-Typing-Device-

This is my attempt at this project. I set out to get my hands on FREE components but then quickly realized this was no easy task. At first I stuck to the templete, but it got boring (quckly). I then put my brain to work and came to the briliant idea of a macropad that types my name. And so the NTD-V1 (Name-Typing-Device) was born.

--------------PCB----------------

I mostly followed the guide for this but restarted it a few times as my own Ideas came into play.

I have an interest studying EE so I really tried to learn from this part. I found it was actually pretty fun, specially when creating the PCB and figuring out the puzzle of connecting the components.

I used KICAD as the guide instructed (Though I am new to it so it took quite a while)

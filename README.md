# NTD-Name-Typing-Device-

This is my attempt at this project. I set out to get my hands on FREE components but then quickly realized this was no easy task. At first I stuck to the templete, but it got boring (quckly). I then put my brain to work and came to the briliant idea of a macropad that types my name. And so the NTD-V1 (Name-Typing-Device) was born.

--------------PCB----------------

I mostly followed the guide for this but restarted it a few times as my own Ideas came into play.

I have an interest studying EE so I really tried to learn from this part. I found it was actually pretty fun, specially when creating the PCB and figuring out the puzzle of connecting the components.

I used KICAD as the guide instructed (Though I am new to it so it took quite a while)

I first built the guide board to figure it out. With what I learned, and some playing around (And a LOT of google) I slowly came up with my personal design incorporating the XIAO-RP2040, 6 switches, an OLED, and two LEDs (That I kinda forgot to remove so they are now official).

(Not Exactly the Latest Version but all is the same exept a few dimensions)

--------------CAD---------------

The guide called for Fusion 360 but im on a low power laptop and have more experience in Onshape, so I designed my Case there.

I started with the bottom and designed it with the dimesnions of my pcb and added a hole for the usb-c where I designed it to be.

After the bottom was completed I designed the top with the key switch layout holes and holes for the Oled and LEDs. I also added some text and made sure the screw holes lined up properlly.
